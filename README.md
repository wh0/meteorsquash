# Run Meteor from squashfs.

And use overlayfs to install new packages.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wh0/meteorsquash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wh0/meteorsquash)

---

## Provided

You can [download](../../releases) the `dist.tar.gz` tarball.
It has the following:

The **install** script sets things up, resulting in something comparable to what https://install.meteor.com/ does.
In fact, part of the script is copied from that URL.
This script internally calls `sudo` to write `/usr/local/bin/meteor`.
**uninstall** undoes that stuff, because I need to do that a lot while developing this.

The **activate** script does the actual mounting.
I don't think you need to call this manually, but if you do,
you have to call it from the directory that contains it.
This script internally calls `sudo`.
**deactivate** unmounts what *activate* mounts.

When the overlayfs is not mounted, `~/.meteor/meteor` is a symlink to **meteor-wrapper**,
which calls *activate* and then calls the real `meteor`.

**bootstrap.squashfs** is Meteor's bootstrap tarball built into a squashfs image.
It excludes the `package-metadata` directory, which contains a database that changes a lot.
We don't know your UID, so everything in it is owned by a dummy UID.

A script in *install* uses information in **patch-data.sh** to hack the UID table in *bootstrap.squashfs*,
making it look like you own everything.

**ro**, **rw**, and **work** are the lower-, upper-, and workdirs for an overlayfs that's mounted to `~/.meteor`.
*ro* is an empty mount point for *bootstrap.squashfs*.
*rw* starts out with the `package-metadata` directory from Meteor's bootstrap tarball.

## Known issues

### Uncompressed packages.data.db
The `packages.data.db` in `rw/package-metadata` is huge and low-entropy.
It's bigger than the squashfs image.
But the Meteor tool needs to write to it all the time.
What can we do about this?

### Limitations of overlayfs
You need Linux 4.2 or later.
Prior to that, this whole thing won't work, because
["Symlinks in /proc/PID/ and /proc/PID/fd which point to a non-directory
object in overlayfs will not contain valid absolute paths, only
relative paths leading up to the filesystem's root."]
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt)
And [that's how Node.js gets its own path](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v0.10.40/deps/uv/src/unix/linux-core.c#L367),
and [that's how Meteor runs your app process](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/9654a7c436b4f65dfa639cc4206fe35a5c46e48c/tools/runners/run-app.js#L232).
Yet somehow, it's working fine on one of my computers.
